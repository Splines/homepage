  What I firmly believe in.

My core beliefs and principles I try to live by as best as I can. Most should be evident given I live in Germany adhering to a "liberal democratic basic order". But what is still evident in today's short-lived, riven society trapped in social media filter bubbles?

- **Respect humans**. Everybody deserves to be seen as an individual. Yes, we live in groups and are born into a culture with given norms and expectations. But that does _not_ justify any unfounded generalizations. Be kind, not violent. Take an interest in other people's life, their past and their dreams, instead of painting everybody with the same brush. People enrich your color palette; they allow you to see more vividly.

- **Take care**. Ask your grand-parents about the time after World War II to quickly realize how privileged we are today in terms of economic status and political stability. We can freely express ourselves and pursue our interests --- which I am very grateful for. But it may lead to an individualistic society, where people are more concerned about themselves than the groups they depend on. Take care of your friends, family & colleagues: show appreciation, engage in activities together and look after their wellbeing. They constitute the basis for your life. But also plan time for yourself and your own thoughts. Me-Time is important to stay sane. As always, it's about finding the right balance.

- **Present facts**. More of them. Anecdotal evidence makes for great and interesting stories. But if you seriously want to make a point in an argument, take the time to compile facts from various, reputable sources. TikTok usually does not fall into this category.

- **Be scientific**. Keep your curiosity alive and explore this amazing world, every day, in both big and small wonders. When you're stuck, dig deeper. Yet, accept that reality is complex; not everything is explicable. Maybe you need to ask differently. Just know that you stand on the shoulder of giants: humans have gathered an incredible wealth of knowledge in various areas. Let's build upon that while keeping a critical mindset. Even experts can make mistakes; that's human after all. But use facts as your superpower.

- **Be patient & diligent**. Regular, deliberate and curious practice --- that's how you learn anything you want. It's never too late. Why not pick up a new instrument in your sixties? Sure, you will probably make less progress in the same time than a 15-year-old, but who cares? Slow, but steady.

- **Sense nature**. Inhale, exhale. Feel the breeze as nitrogen and oxygen slowly enter your lungs. Relax. Earth's biosphere is the backbone of your, of all our lives. So go outside --- really, like a full day outside, aware of all your senses. What an incredible feeling it is to reconnect with the soil. Let's fight for nature's continued existence by keeping greenhouse gas emissions at a minimum where possible. We only have one planet!

- **Wiggle**. Besides rigid facts, norms and manners, embrace your inherent wigglyness in all directions. Not only physically with sport, but also mentally. Everything is connected; swing along your own associative chains. Science, literature, music, dancing, painting, love, sound, touch, warmth, sleep, dreams. Creativity is in you. Try things out. Experiment. Fail. Then stand up. How could you keep wiggling otherwise?

- **Smile**. Not everyday is rose. But life is a wonder and well worth living. Look others in the eye and offer them a smile that comes from the heart. Perhaps you will receive one back.

In summary: Be kind and spread love. Treat everybody equally, with respect and dignity. Take care about your loved ones. Adopt a scientific mindset: Keep your curiosity alive to worship the wonders of this world; Convince me with facts; Help me improve by constructively criticizing me; Maintain a natural skepticism towards everything. But don't take yourself too seriously. And certainly don't loose your wigglyness: Express yourself creatively, fail, stand up, do it again. And again. Smile. It's human after all.
